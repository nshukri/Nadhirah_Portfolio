	<!-- QUEST   -->
	<!-- <span class="text-highlight"> -->
	<p class="project-paragraph">I had the opportunity to design the gameplay UI. The goal was to make players feel like they are playing a console game, but on mobile. The stakeholers provided me with a long list required content to include within a small mobile interface.</p>


	<h3 class="project-heading3">Identifying Player’s Need in a Match</h3>

	<p class="project-paragraph">Due to limited space on screen, there was no way for me to include all the required content. I discussed with the Lead Game Designer on the project to prioritize the content from least to most important. After figuring out what are the core set of information players needed for a match, I had to explain and convince the stakeholders why we weren’t able to include all the content they wanted during gameplay and how we should focus on delivering the core content players need to win the match.</p>

	</figure>

	<p class="project-paragraph">When I was desigining the interaction and UI, I adopted common design patterns from other games. Patterns help players to quickly understand the UI, which is really important in gameplay setting. Players need focus on the game itself and not get distracted by the UI. To deliver gameplay like experience on mobile, I adapted the controller layout to create the controls UI.</p>

	<h3 class="project-heading3">Positive Test Results</h3>


	<p class="project-paragraph">We tested the gameplay UI on UserTesting.com. Players commented how easy it is for them to figure out who is on top during the match and the controls felt great. The positive test result gave us the confirmation we needed and improvements, such as arrows to directed towards enemies.</p>
