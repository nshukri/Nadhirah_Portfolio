	<h3 class="project-heading3">Designing gameplay interaction</h3>

	</figure>
	<!-- QUEST   -->
	<!-- <span class="text-highlight"> -->
	<p class="project-paragraph">Above is the the interface for selecting beasts before the match starts and every time player respawns. Before player selects a beasts, a tip is displayed in the infomation section above the Mount button. Once player selects a beast, the chosen beast's stats are displayed in the information section instead. I wanted players to be able to make informed an decision before entering the battle.</p>

	<!-- gameplay image -->
	<figure class="grid project-content-image">
		<a href="img/bb/bb-gameplay.png" data-lightbox="bb-2" data-title="Beast Brawlers Gameplay screenshot"><img class="grid-item" src="img/bb/bb-gameplay.png" alt="Beast Brawlers Gameplay screenshot"></a>
	</figure>

	<p class="project-paragraph">When designing interaction and interface for gameplay, I had to keep in mind the condition that players be in during a timed match, such as focusing mainly on the beasts and attacking other players. The UI elements needed to be secondary to the central beasts and not distracting their main focus. In a time limited battle, players want to be able to easily know how much time is left and who is on top of the chart, so they can knock them down. Since players will mainly focus on controlling the bests in the center on the screen, I placed the timer at the top middle, so it is easier for players to quickly glance at the remaining time. At the same time, players can so glance to the top left corner to see who is on top.</p>

	<p class="project-paragraph">Since our target audience are those who want PC/console gameplay experience on mobile, They are familiar with controller layout. I decided to adapt joystick and button layout from controllers, so players can easily interpret the UI controls based on their past experience.</p>

	<h3 class="project-heading3">Tips on loading screen to help new players</h3>
	<!-- gameplay image -->
	<figure class="grid project-content-image">
		<a href="img/bb/bb-loading.png" data-lightbox="bb-3" data-title="Beast Brawlers Loading screen"><img class="grid-item" src="img/bb/bb-loading.png" alt="Beast Brawlers loading"></a>
	</figure>

	<p class="project-paragraph">We wanted to find a way to reduce the learning curve for new players, so they don't get easily beaten by more experienced players. Loading wait time for online multiplayer can take awhile due to internet speed, we dicided to utilize this wait time to give players gameplay tips. New players have opportunity to learn more about the gameplay before the match. For returning players, these tips acts as a refresher.</p>
