	<!-- QUEST   -->
	<!-- <span class="text-highlight"> -->
	<p class="project-paragraph">Prior to FIFA Mobile Season 3 launch, we identified that our players needed a better sense of how they should be spending their time in the game across different game modes, such as Vs Attack, Campaign, special Events, and Head to Head. We decided to add Quests as a way for players to find their goals, giving them a better sense of direction in the game. Players want to be able to easily navigate between different types of Quests and see rewards for either each tasks or completion for the entire Quest.</p>

	<p class="project-paragraph">Since Quests is designed to play a major part of the player's experience, the feature needs to be easily accessible from the Main Menu and have a strong CTA (Call To Action). Majority of our players have experience playing other mobile games, and most of them have Quests button located at the bottom right corner of the screen. I decided to leverage this pattern because players familiar with that pattern, and the location is easy for players to press with their thumb.</p>

The Chinese version contains additional features that are not in the global version, such as allowing players to spin the wheel for rewards.</p>

	<p class="grid-item project-paragraph">My role in the Chinese version was mainly reviewing work by designers and artists in Japan, address usability issues and created wireframes for small features or change requests. As of end of 2018, I stopped working on the Chinese version, since the project was moved from Vancouver to Shanghai office.</p>
